The favicon.ico file is a binary file that represents the favicon for the website. Since I cannot generate binary content directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory.

Please ensure that the favicon.ico file is placed in the /portfolio-website/portfolio-website/frontend/public/ directory.
